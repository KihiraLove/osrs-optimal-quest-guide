# Local game data

The draft catalog targets the Jagex live English build 242 snapshot archived on
3 November 2026 at 10:00:06 UTC. Dataset `0.8.0` loads 24 skill tables and
81 draft actions, including The Restless Ghost, the museum route and Enlightened
Journey. Durations estimate each interaction at its waypoint with supplies ready. Travel between
waypoints belongs to the travel graph. An action description identifies any
movement included in its duration.

[The coverage ledger](coverage/build-242.json) inventories identities
independently of the catalog. It links to the pinned journal, diary task, reward
review and optional activity lists. Later data batches reconcile their output
against these IDs. The ledger uses these statuses.

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `expected` | Identified from a source and awaiting normalized mechanics |
| `collected` | Present in the normalized catalog and checked by the validator |
| `reviewed` | Coverage and gameplay facts independently reviewed |
| `excluded` | Outside this route's scope, with a recorded reason |

The journal list preserves the client quest ID. Recipe for Disaster has one
parent goal and ten child activities in the
[stage review](raw/build-242/recipe-for-disaster-review.json). The review records
the finale gate and separates its lamp and quest point from the parent goal.
Equipment, combat, instance transitions and reward details require review
before the stages can enter the loaded catalog.

[Quest Helper observations](raw/build-242/quest-helper/index.json) cover 209
journal activities. They identify candidate coordinates, requirements,
source-specific branches, items and rewards. The remaining helper gaps and
all uncollected entries are explicit in the inventory. The
[publisher reward changes](raw/build-242/quest-month-rewards.json) identify the
build 242 XP updates, including the separately claimed Demon Slayer reward.
The [reward registry](raw/build-242/reward-registry.json) records 38 reward
entries, including seven separate claims. Each claim records its producer ID,
quest gate, available location evidence and known award details. Null values
identify fields that need verification. X Marks the Spot has a loaded producer
and lamp definition. The other packages stay in review while their quest
actions or use rules are being collected.

[Diary observations](raw/build-242/diaries/index.json) link all 492 tracker IDs
to helper steps, requirements and item candidates across 48 tiers. Each tier
has a separate claim record with the taskmaster candidates, lamp values and
travel unlock references. The [optional progression review](raw/build-242/optional-progression-review.json)
tracks pending mechanics for all 19 miniquests, publisher corrections and the
overlap between diary tasks and the essence mine teleports in Enter the Abyss.
Only the three individual task flags are loaded. Complete diary tiers and their
claims require gameplay review before they enter the catalog.

The [museum review](raw/build-242/museum-review.json) links all 14 quiz plaques to
the [archived object tiles](raw/build-242/museum-map.json). Each plaque gives two
kudos and Orlando Smith separately awards 1,000 XP in Hunter and Slayer. The
draft Bone Voyage route checks 100 kudos and imports The Dig Site completion from
profile history while that quest is being normalized. Bone Voyage unlocks the
barge edges and walking routes to six camp facility sites. Clerk rewards, camp
construction, additional travel activations, and fossil acquisition and exhibits
are in gameplay review.

[Balloon stop observations](raw/build-242/balloon-stops.json) record the six
build 242 basket locations and the fuel and skill requirements of discovery.
The draft graph includes four post-quest discovery actions, 30 directed
regular flights, the Entrana ferry, public walks, and one-way Varrock tablet
edges. Read the [travel assumptions](raw/build-242/travel-timing.json) for
packing and timing and the [network review](raw/build-242/travel-review.json)
for open acquisition and transport mechanics.

[Sources](sources.json) records provenance and reuse terms. See
[attribution](ATTRIBUTION.md) for the third-party notices and
[reconciliation](raw/build-242/reconciliation.json) for field-level decisions.
A pending review preserves its evidence and reason until a verified value is
available. The [main baseline](profiles/main-baseline.json) records the goal
list, policies and modeled Lumbridge arrival with one quest point. The
[starter supplies](catalog/starter-supplies/actions.json) are purchases at the
Grand Exchange under the trade-enabled and sufficient-GP policies.

[The Restless Ghost review](raw/build-242/restless-ghost-review.json) records the
amulet and skull pickups, the route that leaves the skeleton behind, and the
Prayer XP and quest point at the coffin. It also records the remaining gameplay
checks for the waypoint and duration estimates.
